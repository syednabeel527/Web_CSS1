    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, tours in war-torn Afghanistan with his best friend and military liaison, James "Rhodey" Rhodes, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings, and Stark is gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackers—one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.</p>

    <h3>Production</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>In April 1990, Universal Pictures bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen,[39] with Stuart Gordon to direct a low-budget film based on the property.[15] By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired the rights from Universal.[40] In January 1997, Nicolas Cage expressed interest in portraying the character,[41] while in September 1998, Tom Cruise expressed interest in producing as well as starring in an Iron Man film.[42] Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay. It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured MODOK as the villain. Tom Rothman, President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.[43] That October, Quentin Tarantino was approached to write and direct the film.[44] Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and "we can't make them all.</p>

    <h4>Filming</h4>
    <p>Production was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California.[87] Howard Hughes was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built.[22] Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.</p>
